Also fixed relations between lp_var's and definitions in calc_restrictions that I should have changed previously.

[32m|[m * [33m1a6948f[m Started changing other attributes of ingredients to an index-based system ('LOI' -> '0', 'cost' -> '1', 'clay' -> '2')
[32m|[m * [33m3dcd9ef[m Added the other restrictions 'KNaO UMF' and 'KNaO % mol', and changed the order in which the other restrictions appear.
[32m|[m * [33m1f9b521[m Fixed newly discovered bug where 'other restrictions' were being displayed on top of each other. Fixed the one known case where the 2d projection failed, by renormalizing the objective functions in the algorithm. No guarantee this will work in all cases.
[32m|[m * [33ma9695d8[m Revert "RENAMED RESTRICTION_CLASS.PY AND RECIPE_CLASS.PY TO RESTRICTIONS.PY AND RECIPES.PY RESPECTIVELY .

* [33m4dae207[m Replaced the objective_defn attribute of the Other class with numerator_coefs, which is a dictionary with keys names of lp variables, and values real numbers. Redefined the restrictions coming from instances of the Other class, and uncommented sections in recipe_class.py so that the 'other restrictions' now work.
